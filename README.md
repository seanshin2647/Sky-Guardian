# Sky-Guardian
**Made By: Sean Shin**

Sky Guardian (tentative name) will be a game similar in design to the game that is displayed when one searches "zerg rush" on Google.

# Description
The game will consist of a player, armed with multiple different weapons flying in a gunship, protecting multiple bases on the ground.

Enemies (tentaviely named "enemies") will appear from the edges of the screen to attack bases. They will head towards the nearest base.

If all bases are destroyed, the player will lose.

# Controls
As of now, no concrete plans for controls.
